# Online Integrated Platform for Student Projects

## Overview

This Android application aims to provide an **online integrated platform** for managing student projects. Developed using Kotlin, Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, and Firebase, the app addresses key challenges in student project management and collaboration.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.
- **Android Studio**: Integrated development environment (IDE) used for building the app.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for building native Android UIs.
- **Firebase**: Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for real-time database and authentication.
- **Un-Uploaded Flask Backend** - Proper backend was ready but due to server issues, could not upload.

## Problem Statement

During the development of this app, our team identified a significant issue within our college society: **miscommunication** and missed opportunities for collaboration. This issue highlighted the need for a platform where students could easily manage and collaborate on their projects.

## Challenges Faced

Our team faced several challenges throughout the development process:

- **Backend Development**: Creating a robust backend to handle the app's numerous functionalities and features was a major hurdle. We initially attempted to build the backend using Pythonâ€™s Flask and MySQL, making significant progress.

- **Deployment Issues**: Despite our progress, we encountered issues with hosting the backend on online platforms, which hindered our ability to deploy and showcase the app effectively.

## Progress and Achievements

- Successfully developed a comprehensive Android application with essential features for project management and collaboration.
- Implemented real-time data handling and user authentication using Firebase.
- Made considerable strides in backend development with Flask and MySQL, though deployment challenges were encountered.

## Conclusion

This project represents our commitment to solving real-world problems faced by students in project management and collaboration. Despite the challenges, our progress in app development and backend creation showcases our dedication to innovation and problem-solving. We hope this platform will serve as a valuable tool for students, enhancing their ability to manage and collaborate on projects effectively.

Thank you for exploring our project! We welcome feedback and contributions to help us continue improving this platform.
